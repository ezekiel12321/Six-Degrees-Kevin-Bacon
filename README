**Six-Degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon is an efficient C++ program designed to solve the famous "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" game. By leveraging graph data structures and Breadth-First Search algorithms, the program parses large datasets of movie credits from IMDB and computes the shortest path between any two given actors, highlighting their connections through shared movies.**

Key Features
Efficient graph representation and search algorithms for fast processing of complex input files.
Parses and processes large datasets of movie credits (over 100,000 movies and actors).
Provides a versatile tool for users to discover connections between actors and explore the movie industry landscape.
Includes sample input and output files for testing and demonstration purposes.
Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up and run the program on your local machine.

Prerequisites
To run this program, you will need a C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later) and the make utility.

Running the Program
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Six-Degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon.git

Change to the project directory:
cd Six-Degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon

Compile the program using the provided Makefile:

make

This will create an executable file named sixdegrees.

Run the program with the input and output file as command-line arguments:

./sixdegrees input_file.txt output_file.txt
Replace input_file.txt with the path to your input file and output_file.txt with the desired path for the output file.
